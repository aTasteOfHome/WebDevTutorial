# WebDevTutorial

Objective: To help someone get started started on WebDev,

- simple localhost server; let's do a bare bones node express
    -  git clone, npm install, npm start, go to the url
- index.js + index.html
    - web page will say Hello, new developer!
- Stub out a "Resume" in html + Mustache, and have index.js populate it with fake data
    - optionally spend time going over html box model, css styling (porbably not too much; we'll go into more detail later)
    - teach user about:
        - using printlines, debugger
        - variables, assignment, data types
        - if/else, switch
        - loops
        - methods, functions
            - stuff like .map, .find, etc.
- Remove the fake data in index.js, and have it instead make calls to server for data
    - have server make calls to a stubbed database
    - user learns about callbacks/promises/event dispatching
- User git clones another tutorial repository (for SQL stuff), but clones from a tag that has all the info already stubbed out
    - stuff shows up on screen again!
- Have the user create a new section for education that they edit directly on the page
    - Introduce input fields on website, so user can update their resume from the webpage
        - This makes POST requests, which does SQL inserts and updates
        - User learns some basic SQL in the process
    - User learns SQL select statements to get education info
- Go ham on html css, introduce the idea of .scss and convert to that
    - optionally introduce idea of react-redux
- But anyone can update your code now! Introduce auth
    - Introduce more and more security exploits that they will now have to code against
        - SQL injection
        - cross site scripting
- Introduce tables, long running processes, and other things that are easier to deal with using data structures, various programming techniques
    - queue
    - stack
    - set
    - hashtable
    - map
    - recursion
        - dynamic programming
    - sorting
    - OO
        - classes
        - inheritance
    - functional programming
        - passing around functions as parameters
        - advantage of stateless stuff 
- teach user about flexbox, css-grid, tables, etc.
- Introduce react and redux; something that may address some of the growing pains the user may be encountering.
